## How it works

It is a linear feedback shift register random number generator connected to a wishbone bus to allow it to fit within the pin constraints of Tiny Tapeout.

## How to test

Please see the cocotb testbench in the test.py in the test directory for the startup procedure for loading a seed and starting the linear feedback shift register output.

## External hardware

Use the microcontroller on the development board to apply the correct startup signals to the board.
